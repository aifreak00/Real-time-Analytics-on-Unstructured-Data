## Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Apache Spark, AWS libraries, and Python libraries.

2. **Configure AWS Access Keys:** Update the `config.py` file with your AWS credentials.

3. **Start the Containers:** Use Docker Compose to set up the environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run the Spark Job:** Execute the Spark job with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it My_spark_unstructured-spark-master-1 spark-submit \
   --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
   --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.1,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.11.469 \
   main.py
   ```

## Detailed Explanation

### Data Sources

The project supports multiple types of unstructured data:

- **Text Files:** Plain text files containing raw data or logs.
- **JSON Files:** JavaScript Object Notation files for structured data representation.
- **PDF Files:** Portable Document Format files for document analysis.
- **CSV Files:** Comma-Separated Values files for tabular data.
- **Video Files:** Multimedia files for video processing and analysis.
- **Image Files:** Graphics files for image processing and recognition.

### Data Processing

Using **Spark Streaming**, the project ingests data in real-time, allowing for immediate processing and analysis. **User-defined functions (UDFs)** are employed to extract and clean data, ensuring it is in a usable format for analysis. The data is then transformed and analyzed to derive meaningful insights.

### Output

The processed data is stored in **Parquet** format on **AWS S3**. Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks, providing efficient data compression and encoding schemes.

### AWS Integration

The project leverages **AWS S3** for storing the processed data. S3 offers durable and scalable storage, making it ideal for handling large datasets. Additionally, **AWS Glue Crawler** is used to create tables from the Parquet files and store them in a database, facilitating easy querying and data previewing.

### Crawling, Previewing, and Verifying Results

AWS Glue Crawler reads the data in the Parquet files, creates a table schema, and stores it in a database. This allows for seamless data exploration and verification of results.
